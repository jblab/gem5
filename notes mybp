Design

Constraints/Degrees of Freedom:
Storage Budget?
32kbits to 1MBits?

Theoretical Analysis:

How is geometric series history lengths better than having single history? 
Accomodates variable history lengths. But is there a better distribution that geometric?

Comparison of hash_fn/mod/bitXOR/bitAND indices?


Theoretical Improvement:


Lookup?
Saturated Arithmetric
XOR Tree 

Acronyms:
soa: state-of-art
